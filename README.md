We received an extension from Mark as one of our Team members dropped this course last minute. 

## Registration for a User

If a User does not have an account and wishes to create one then they can go to our Log In page and click the link below that says "Register now". In the Registration form, the User must create a Username that is not in our database and input information needed for their account. Once it says " Successfully Registered" the User will be taken to the Log In page to Log in. 


## Logging In As an User
You can log in as a user using credentials username = `user` and password = `user`. Once the User logs in, they will be taken to the Homepage where they can explore our website. They can click on our featured and popular items which will take them to that specific product page. 


## Logging In As an Admin

 For admin use username = `admin` and password = `admin`. As admin you are able to add new products, delete products, edit existing ones, see user recommendations and remove users.

To add designer Products the admin will fill out the "Add Products" page.
To add dupes the admin will fill out the "Add Dupes" page.

In order to link the dupe to the designer product, the admin will have to take the object ids from the database and fill out the percentage of how much they match. 

The admin will also be able to search and make sure they do not add any duplicate products into the database.

The product toggle allows the admin to choose what they want to be featured on the homepage. 

In the Users section of the admin page, the admin can approve or reject suggestions sent in by the users and delete any users. 


## Using the Home Page

The home page allows users to click on featured and popular products to view information about them including their dupes. You can also search for a specific product using the search bar which will return a results page displaying matching products.

## How to use My Account

In the Accounts page, the user may edit their personal information. While they can edit the name displayed on their account, it will not change their Log In information, it will only change the username displayed on their view of the Account sort of like a Nickname. 

The likes list is a list of all the products the User has liked and they are able to remove the products from their list. 

The suggestion form is for the User to suggest Designer products that they wish to see dupes for on our site. Once they suggest something, it will show up with either an "Approved","Rejected" or "Pending" status. The dupes that they suggested on the Product Pages will also show up here. 


## Products List Page

The page simply displays a list of products. Each product entry can be clicked on which will lead to the product's specific page. The list of products can be sorted by price and name. It can also filter the product list by which category of products they wish to see. If they click on "Nars Blush", They will be able to see a list of dupes. This list can be sorted by price. The User will also be able to thumbs up or thumbs down a product. The thumbs up will add it to their "likes" list which can be found in the "My Account" page. The thumbs up and down will showcase how much a product is liked by the users on our website. The User can also suggest a dupe on each product page and fill out the form. The suggestion will be sent to Admin and the User will be able to see their pending suggestion in their Account page.
